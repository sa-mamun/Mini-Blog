Configuration:
1. You need to create database first and then change connection string inside web.config.
2. No need to create table. I also added seed for Admin account and Role for both Admin, User. Applied Role Base Authorization
3. Just run the project and seed will be applied.
4. Defaul Admin email: admin@gmail.com and password: M@mun009
5. Admin can add additional admin from admin panel. Password is same for all admin by default.
